This is a discord server bot that I made, it takes in the user input and forwards the data to a google sheet for convenience of patrol log submission within the server.

To use this bot, you will need to create a file in the root directory named "history.json" and add inside:

{ "patrol_id": 0 }

I did not include this file in for final version as I've decided to add history.json to .gitignore since it's constantly updated locally every time.
